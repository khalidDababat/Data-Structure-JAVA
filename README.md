# Java Data Structures Implementation

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of various data structures using Java. It is designed to help students and developers understand how these structures work under the hood. Each data structure is implemented from scratch, with detailed comments and example use cases.

## Features

- **Array**: Dynamic arrays with support for resizing and CRUD operations.
- **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
- **Stack**: Stack operations (push, pop, peek) with both array-based and linked-list-based approaches.
- **Queue**: Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue) with both array-based and linked-list-based approaches.
- **Priority Queue**: Efficient insertion and retrieval based on priority.
- **Hash Table**: Key-value storage with collision handling using separate chaining and open addressing.
- **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary trees, including traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Enhanced binary tree with search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Heap**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.
- **Graph**: Adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations, with traversal methods (BFS and DFS).
- **Trie**: Efficient prefix tree for string operations.
